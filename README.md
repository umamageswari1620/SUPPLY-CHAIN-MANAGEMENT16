                                              Phase5: Project Demonstration & Documentation

Title: AI-Powered Supply Chain Management System

Abstract:
The AI-Driven Supply Chain Management System aims to transform logistics and inventory operations using artificial intelligence, predictive analytics, and IoT technologies. In this final phase, the system integrates AI for demand forecasting, real-time tracking through IoT sensors, and secure data exchange within ERP systems. This document presents a comprehensive report covering system demonstration, technical documentation, performance analysis, source code, and testing outcomes. Built for scalability and operational efficiency, this solution ensures just-in-time delivery, warehouse automation, and predictive restocking. ERP diagrams, system screenshots, and codebase snapshots are included to illustrate system design and operation.
 1.  Project Demonstration
Overview:
The SCM system demonstration presents intelligent automation features, real-time tracking, demand prediction, and integration with enterprise logistics modules.
Demonstration Details:
•	System Walkthrough: A live demonstration showing the supply chain dashboard, order management flow, and predictive restocking system.
•	AI Forecasting Accuracy: The AI’s ability to forecast demand based on sales history, seasonal trends, and market behavior is showcased.
•	IoT Integration: IoT sensors in warehouses and delivery vehicles track real-time location, temperature, and stock levels.
•	Performance Metrics: Load capacity, system responsiveness under peak usage, and forecasting precision are analyzed.
•	Security & Privacy: Encryption protocols and access control are demonstrated to protect sensitive logistics data.
Outcome:
The demonstration confirms the system’s ability to enhance supply chain visibility, efficiency, and responsiveness in real-world logistics environments.
